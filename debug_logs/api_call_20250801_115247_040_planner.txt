- **User's latest request:** Tôi muốn thi công như hình

## CRITICAL TOOL SELECTION LOGIC:

### A. DIRECT RESPONSE SCENARIOS (plan = [])
1. **Chitchat/Greetings:** "Hello", "Hi", "Thank you", "Goodbye", "Xin chào", "Cảm ơn", "Tạm biệt"
2. **Missing Critical Information:**
   - Has budget but missing room area/dimensions → Ask for room size
   - Has area but unclear materials → Ask for material preferences
   - Vague requests → Request specific information
3. **Too Many Out-of-Stock Materials:** >3 items not in database → Suggest alternatives
4. **Materials Not in Database:** User asks about unavailable materials → Explain limitations
5. **Information Already Available:** Can answer from history without tools

### B. TOOL SELECTION PRIORITY (SINGLE STEP)

#### 1. **get_categories_new** (Category listing)
- **Condition:** Công ty đang thi công những hạng mục nào?"
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Get all available material categories"

#### 2. **get_material_types_new** (Material types in category)
- **Condition:** Người dùng hỏi về các loại vật liệu trong một danh mục cụ thể.
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Get material types for category '[category]'"

#### 3. **get_market_price_new** (Market price search)
- **Condition:** User asks for market prices
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Search market price for '[material_name]'"

#### 4. **get_internal_price_new** (Specific material price query)
- **Condition:** User asks for specific material price
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Query internal price for [category] - [material_type] - [subtype]"

#### 5. **get_material_price_ranges** (Material price range by surface)
- Condition: If budget is null and area_map is available (even with null area) → ALWAYS call this tool. Missing area will be treated as 0.
- NEVER skip this tool due to missing area.
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Provide material price ranges for surfaces: [area_map details with area (if don't have area, set it to 0)]"

#### 6. **propose_options_for_budget** (Suggest materials by budget and area)
- **Condition:** User or History summary has provided budget AND area_map with specific materials and area
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Propose material options suitable for budget [X] million for surfaces: [area_map details]"


### C. MULTI-STEP SCENARIOS
1. **Mixed Materials (in-stock + out-of-stock):**
   - Step 1: Query internal prices for available materials
   - Step 2: Search market prices for unavailable materials
   - Step 3: Aggregate and compare results
2. **Material Comparison:**
   - Step 1: Get price for material A
   - Step 2: Get price for material B
   - Step 3: Compare and recommend

## TOOL USAGE PATTERNS

## REAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Direct response - Missing information
```json
{
  "plan": [],
  "response_reason": "User missing room area/dimensions information for accurate quotation."
}
```

### Example 2: Budget + Area_map exists → propose_options_for_budget
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Propose material options suitable for budget 300 million for surfaces: sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ, 24m²), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao, 24m²), tường (Tường và vách - Sơn, 60m²)"
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Area_map only (no budget) → get_material_price_ranges
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Provide material price ranges for surfaces: sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ, 24m²), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao, 24m²)"
  ]
}
```

### Example 4: Simple material search
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Search materials with keyword 'gỗ'"
  ]
}
```

### Example 5: Specific price query
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Query internal price for Sàn - Sàn gỗ"
  ]
}
```

### Example 6: Multi-steps - Mixed materials (in-stock + out-of-stock)
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Query internal price for Sàn - Sàn gỗ",
    "Step 2: Search market price for 'vách ốp đá'",
    "Step 3: Aggregate and compare results from step 1 and step 2"
  ]
}
```
### Example 7: User wants to change wall material to stone (not in database) and update the quotation accordingly
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Search market price for 'tường ốp đá'",
    "Step 2: Propose material options suitable for budget 150 million for surfaces: sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ, 30m²), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao, 30m²)",
    "Step 3: Aggregate and update final quotation by combining market price from step 1 with internal quotation from step 2 using 42m² for tường ốp đá"
  ]
}
## IMPORTANT NOTES
- **NEVER** invent materials not in area_map
- **NEVER** use materials not in database catalog
- **ALWAYS** use Vietnamese parameter values
- **ALWAYS** prioritize solutions with fewest steps possible
- **ONLY USE** area_map and budget from history summary, history summary is the source of truth for budget and area_map.
- If budget or area from history summary is null, decide the plan with available information.

## Your Task
Based on the logic above, analyze the request and return JSON with "plan" and "response_reason" (when plan is empty).

Area Map:
- sàn: {'position': 'sàn', 'category': 'Sàn', 'material_type': 'Sàn gỗ', 'sub_type': None, 'variant': None, 'area': None}
- trần: {'position': 'trần', 'category': 'Trần', 'material_type': 'Trần thạch cao', 'sub_type': None, 'variant': None, 'area': None}

=== RESPONSE FROM API ===
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to construct their room as shown in the image. From the context analysis, the existing materials are wooden floor and stone wall panels, but the system detected that the stone wall panels aren't available in the database. Also, there's no budget or room size provided.

First, I need to check what tools to use. The user's request is vague because they didn't mention the budget or dimensions. The area_map has the materials but without specific areas. According to the tool selection logic, if the budget is null and the area_map is available (even with null areas), we should call get_material_price_ranges. 

So the plan should be to provide material price ranges for the surfaces mentioned. The user might need an estimate based on the materials they have, but since the stone wall panels aren't in the database, maybe that's a problem. But the current step is to check the price ranges. 

Wait, the user's latest request is "Tôi muốn thi công như hình" which means they want to build it as in the image. The system already identified the materials present but noted that the stone wall panels aren't available. However, the current task is to generate the plan based on the available info. 

Since the budget is null and the area_map exists but with null areas, the correct tool is get_material_price_ranges. The response should ask for the room dimensions to proceed further. But according to the instructions, if the budget is null and area_map exists, we call get_material_price_ranges. So the plan is to provide price ranges for the existing materials, but since the area is missing, it might be treated as 0. 

But the user might need to provide the area. However, the tool logic says to always call get_material_price_ranges when budget is null and area_map exists, even if area is null. So the plan is to use that tool. The response reason would be that the user hasn't provided the room area, so we need to ask for it. But according to the example, if the area is null, the tool is called, and the response might be a request for the area. 

Wait, looking at the example 3: when area_map has null areas, the plan is to call get_material_price_ranges. The response would then be to ask for the area. But in the JSON output, the plan is to call the tool, and the response_reason would explain that the area is missing. 

So the correct plan here is to call get_material_price_ranges with the available materials but since the area is null, the tool might return a range based on average or ask for the area. But according to the instructions, the plan is to call the tool, and the response_reason would state that the user needs to provide the room area. 

Therefore, the JSON should have the plan as get_material_price_ranges and the response_reason explaining the missing area.
