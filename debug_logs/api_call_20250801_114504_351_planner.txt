## CRITICAL TOOL SELECTION LOGIC:

### A. DIRECT RESPONSE SCENARIOS (plan = [])
1. **Chitchat/Greetings:** "Hello", "Hi", "Thank you", "Goodbye", "Xin chào", "Cảm ơn", "Tạm biệt"
2. **Missing Critical Information:**
   - Has budget but missing room area/dimensions → Ask for room size
   - Has area but unclear materials → Ask for material preferences
   - Vague requests → Request specific information
3. **Too Many Out-of-Stock Materials:** >3 items not in database → Suggest alternatives
4. **Materials Not in Database:** User asks about unavailable materials → Explain limitations
5. **Information Already Available:** Can answer from history without tools

### B. TOOL SELECTION PRIORITY (SINGLE STEP)

#### 1. **get_categories_new** (Category listing)
- **Condition:** Công ty đang thi công những hạng mục nào?"
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Get all available material categories"

#### 2. **get_material_types_new** (Material types in category)
- **Condition:** Người dùng hỏi về các loại vật liệu trong một danh mục cụ thể.
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Get material types for category '[category]'"

#### 3. **get_market_price_new** (Market price search)
- **Condition:** User asks for market prices
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Search market price for '[material_name]'"

#### 4. **get_internal_price_new** (Specific material price query)
- **Condition:** User asks for specific material price
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Query internal price for [category] - [material_type] - [subtype]"

#### 5. **get_material_price_ranges** (Material price range by surface)
- Condition: If budget is null AND area_map exists → MUST call this tool, set missing area to 0 if area not provided by history summary or user.
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Provide material price ranges for surfaces: [area_map details with area (if don't have area, set it to 0)]"

#### 6. **propose_options_for_budget** (Suggest materials by budget and area)
- **Condition:** User or History summary has provided budget AND area_map with specific materials and area
- **Usage:** "Step 1: Propose material options suitable for budget [X] million for surfaces: [area_map details]"


### C. MULTI-STEP SCENARIOS
1. **Mixed Materials (in-stock + out-of-stock):**
   - Step 1: Query internal prices for available materials
   - Step 2: Search market prices for unavailable materials
   - Step 3: Aggregate and compare results
2. **Material Comparison:**
   - Step 1: Get price for material A
   - Step 2: Get price for material B
   - Step 3: Compare and recommend

## TOOL USAGE PATTERNS

### propose_options_for_budget (ONLY when budget + area_map exist)

## REAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Direct response - Missing information
```json
{
  "plan": [],
  "response_reason": "User missing room area/dimensions information for accurate quotation."
}
```

### Example 2: Budget + Area_map exists → propose_options_for_budget
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Propose material options suitable for budget 300 million for surfaces: sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ, 24m²), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao, 24m²), tường (Tường và vách - Sơn, 60m²)"
  ]
}
```

### Example 3: Area_map only (no budget) → get_material_price_ranges
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Provide material price ranges for surfaces: sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ, 24m²), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao, 24m²)"
  ]
}
```

### Example 4: Simple material search
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Search materials with keyword 'gỗ'"
  ]
}
```

### Example 5: Specific price query
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Query internal price for Sàn - Sàn gỗ"
  ]
}
```

### Example 6: Multi-steps - Mixed materials (in-stock + out-of-stock)
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Query internal price for Sàn - Sàn gỗ",
    "Step 2: Search market price for 'vách ốp đá'",
    "Step 3: Aggregate and compare results from step 1 and step 2"
  ]
}
```
### Example 7: User wants to change wall material to stone (not in database) and update the quotation accordingly
```json
{
  "plan": [
    "Step 1: Search market price for 'tường ốp đá'",
    "Step 2: Propose material options suitable for budget 150 million for surfaces: sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ, 30m²), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao, 30m²)",
    "Step 3: Aggregate and update final quotation by combining market price from step 1 with internal quotation from step 2 using 42m² for tường ốp đá"
  ]
}
## IMPORTANT NOTES
- **NEVER** invent materials not in area_map
- **NEVER** use materials not in database catalog
- **ALWAYS** use Vietnamese parameter values
- **ALWAYS** prioritize solutions with fewest steps possible
- **ONLY USE** area_map and budget from history summary, history summary is the source of truth for budget and area_map.
- If budget or area from history summary is null, decide the plan with available information.

## Your Task
Based on the logic above, analyze the request and return JSON with "plan" and "response_reason" (when plan is empty).

Area Map:
- sàn: {'position': 'sàn', 'category': 'Sàn', 'material_type': 'Sàn gỗ', 'sub_type': None, 'variant': None, 'area': None}
- trần: {'position': 'trần', 'category': 'Trần', 'material_type': 'Trần thạch cao', 'sub_type': None, 'variant': None, 'area': None}

=== RESPONSE FROM API ===
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to proceed with the quotation for their interior design project. The context provided shows that they've already uploaded an image of the room, and the system has identified the existing materials: wooden floor (sàn gỗ), stone wall (but not available in the database), and gypsum ceiling (trần thạch cao). However, there's no information about the budget or the room's dimensions.

First, I need to check what tools are available. The user's latest request is "Tôi muốn thi công như hình," which translates to "I want to build it as in the image." But since the system has already identified the materials, the next step is to get the necessary details to proceed with the quotation.

Looking at the tools, the key ones are get_material_price_ranges and propose_options_for_budget. However, the budget is null, and the area_map has areas as null. So, according to the logic, if there's no budget and the area is missing, we should use get_material_price_ranges. But wait, the area is required for pricing. The user hasn't provided the room's size, so the system can't calculate the exact cost. 

In the context analysis, the area_map has 'area' as null for both sàn and trần. So, the system needs to ask for the room's dimensions. But according to the tool selection logic, if the budget is null and the area is missing, we should call get_material_price_ranges, but without the area, that might not be possible. Wait, the tool get_material_price_ranges requires the area to provide price ranges. However, in the history summary, the area is not provided. 

So, the correct step here is to first ask the user for the room's dimensions. But according to the tool selection, if the budget is null and the area is missing, we should call get_material_price_ranges. But without the area, how can we proceed? Maybe the tool can handle it by using the existing material types and providing price ranges based on the category, but the user might need to specify the area. 

Wait, looking at the example 3 in the tool usage patterns, when the area is null, the plan is to call get_material_price_ranges with the surfaces as "sàn (Sàn - Sàn gỗ), trần (Trần - Trần thạch cao)". So even without the area, the system can provide price ranges for the materials. However, the user might need to provide the area to get an accurate quotation. 

But according to the current context, the user hasn't provided the area. So the system should first get the price ranges for the materials identified (sàn gỗ and trần thạch cao) without the area, and then prompt the user to provide the room's dimensions for a precise quote. 

Alternatively, since the area is required for pricing, the system might need to ask the user for the area first. However, the tool selection logic says that if the budget is null and the area is missing, use get_material_price_ranges. So the plan would be to call that tool to get the price ranges for the existing materials, and then proceed from there. 

Therefore, the correct action is to use get_material_price_ranges with the available materials (sàn gỗ and trần thạch cao) and inform the user that the area is needed for an accurate quotation. But according to the tool usage examples, even without the area, the tool can be called. So the plan would be to call get_material_price_ranges for the surfaces mentioned in the area_map, and then the response would include the price ranges, and the user would be asked to provide the area for a detailed quote.
